      "instruction": "When computing a probability in a finite sample space, especially with dice, cards, or coins, consider whether the complement event is simpler to count. After obtaining the desired probability directly, quickly recompute it via the complement (or vice versa) as a consistency check. Apply this particularly when the event is expressed as 'at least', 'at most', or 'not something', to reduce counting mistakes and to validate the result."

      "name": "behavior_enumerate_outcomes_systematically",
      "instruction": "For problems involving counting discrete outcomes (such as sums of dice rolls), use a systematic enumeration method: list outcomes in a grid, table, or by fixing one variable and varying the other. Ensure you follow a clear pattern (e.g., fix the first die and list all possibilities for the second) to avoid missing or double-counting outcomes. Use this structured enumeration whenever you need to list all small-case outcomes or verify combinatorial counts."
